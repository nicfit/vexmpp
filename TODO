TODO
----

- Important
   - Ability to do TLS with immediate handshake (443, 5223, etc.)
   - Remove callback methods that are not async (connectionFailed is the
     same as the exceptions raised by openConnection, e.g.). Rethink...
     use asyncio.Event???
   - timeouts in protocol functions
   - login-stress
     - Multi-proc
     - Abstract login strategy for different implementations
   - Application signal handers, might help cancelling pending tasks (cleanup)
   - Disco support... particularly when a mixin is constructed and added to 
     a stream the streams DiscoMixin/map should be updated to reflect that
     the new mixin is suported (jabber:iq:version, etc.)

- Useful
   - SSL Context options, lock down, cert vaildation, etc.
   - Allow "by" attributes on stanza errors.
   ~ bind errors
   - jabber:iq:register via stream:feature (not legacy)

- Meh
   - jabber:iq:auth via stream:feature (not legacy)
